The Concentric design is originally from the Google Pixel Watch (1). This project recreates it using [Watch Face Format](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/wff). 

## Modify the Watch Face

The XML code can be found in the `res/raw` folder. Watch Face Format is well [documented](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/wff/watch-face) in case you wish to modify the watch face.


## Build the Watch Face

> Google has transitioned to Gradle for compiling watch faces, but I still use the original build script provided when WFF first launched. For reference on building a watch face, see [wear-os-samples/WatchFaceFormat](https://github.com/android/wear-os-samples/tree/main/WatchFaceFormat).

To streamline the process, Iâ€™ve developed a small CLI tool that integrates this script, removing the need for Gradle. Once it's ready, I plan to publish it on GitHub.
